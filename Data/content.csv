He must be able to cause the hind fee to follow exactly in the tracks of the forefeet.\nIn a correctly executed turn or circle the horse’s inside hind leg carries more weight than the outside one.  Before every \nturn or circle the rider should prepare the horse with a half halt and transfer his weight a little to the inside seat bone, in \nthe direction of the movement.\nThe horse should then be flexed in the same direction.  The inside rein should guide the horse into the turn, the rider’s \ninside leg, close to the girth, causing the horse’s inside hind leg to reach further forward.  The outside rein should yield \njust enough to allow the horse to flex to the inside, while at the same time it restrains the horse from falling out over the \noutside shoulder.  The outside leg should control the quarters.\nWhen the horse’s forehand is guided from the straight line into the direction of the turn, the influence of the inside rein \nis decreased again.  The rider should ‘straighten’ the horse with the outside rein, keep the horse exactly on the line of the \ncircle. (‘Straight’ on the circle means making sure that the hind feet follow in the tracks of the forefeet, and that the horse \nis bent from head to tail according to the curvature of the line.)\nThe correct distribution of the rider’s weight is most important.  In transferring his weight to the inside seat bone he \nshould push the inside hip forward with a deep knee.  This will also prevent him from collapsing his inside hip and slip-\nping the seat to the outside.  At the same time he should make sure not to leave the outside shoulder behind.\nOnly when sitting correctly with correct distribution of weight can the rider bend his horse as needed.\nRiding a Corner\nTo ride a corner correctly it is necessary to apply a half halt six metres (20 feet) away from the wall ahead.  The horse \nshould be flexed to the inside, then the corner should be ridden like a quarter volte (6-metre circle).  Aids and bend \nshould be similar to those riding a circle.\nIf the horse tried to cut the corner, not bending laterally, the rider must counteract with strong inside aids.  A rider at pre-\nliminary stage is advised to practice riding a corner at a walk, and to give the aids one after another rather than simulta-\nneously.  Also he should not make the mistake of guiding the horse’s head and neck too deep into the corner, thus coming \nout of it with the wrong bend.\nIt is also incorrect to ride the horse deeper into the corner by bringing both hands to the outside, with the inside hand \ncrossing the mane.  This causes the horse to fall out over the shoulder.\nWhen riding a turn out of doors the rider must ensure that the horse does not try to avoid bending correctly by approach-\ning the turn not on a straight line but on an outward curve.\nBefore changing rein on the riding school diagonal the rider has to ensure that the horse does not turn too soon.  After \nthe corner, inside leg and outside rein keep the horse straight on the track for one horse’s length.  Only when the horse’s \noutside shoulder reaches the marker should the rider start the turn across the diagonal.  If there is no wall the outside aids \nhave to keep the horse on the curvature of the turn and not allow him to fall out.'' metadata={''source'': ''basicexercises.pdf'', ''page'': 0}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.255354,

The circumference of the circle is determined by the circle markers.\nThe rider’s inside leg, close behind the girth, activates the inside hind leg, helping to maintain the lateral bend and \npreventing the horse from falling into the circle.  The rider’s outside leg should be positioned further behind the girth, \ncontrolling the quarters.  The rider’s outside leg, together with the inside rein, should maintain the lateral bend and cause \nthe outside hind leg to step further forward.\nWhen changing rein on a figure of eight the horse should be straightened for a moment before flexing and bending him \nin the new direction.  The same applies for changing ‘through’ the circle.  The rider must be careful not to ride too wide a \nfirst half-circle so that the second half-circle can be of equal diameter.\nWhen changing either out of or through the circle the rider must shorten the new inside rein, transferring his weight to \nthe new inside seat bone, and changing the leg aids accordingly.\nThe Volte\nThe volte is a small circle 6m (20ft) in diameter.  It calls for the most acute lateral bend that a horse can perform on one \ntrack, and can be ridden only in collected paces.  Should a volte of a smaller diameter (5 metres or 16 feet) be attempted, \nthe horse could no longer bend laterally according to the line of movement.  The quarters would fall out and the rhythm \nof the pace would become irregular.  Therefore in preliminary training, when the horse is not yet able to move in collec-\ntion, a volte should not be attempted.  On the subject of turns or circles, it is absolutely essential to avoid over-use of the \ninside rein aid, which causes the quarters to fall out or the rhythm to be broken.  Remember, too, that the outside rein \nmust maintain an elastic contact.  Pressing down the inside heel will ensure correct distribution of weight, bringing it \nmore on to the inside seat bone.\nOtherwise the aids for riding a volte are the same as for riding a circle.\nThe most common rider fault when riding a volte is to change its shape into an oval.  The volte must be absolutely round \nand must end where it began.  A novice rider can make sure of this by placing the volte intentionally a little in front of \nwhere it touches the track.\nTo improve this movement it is helpful to ride a few voltes, one after another, in the same place.\nHalf-Circles\nWhen riding a half-circle and inclining back to the track, the aids for the first part of the movement are the same as for \nthe volte.  A half-volte is ridden in a 5m (16ft) diameter.  It is usually ridden in the second corner of a long side.  At the \nwidest part of the half-volte the rider inclines toward a straight line back to the track, touching the same 10.50m (35ft) \nafter the corner.\nLoops\nDepending on their number and size, loops are used either as exercises for making the horse supple or as preparation for \ncollection.  The number of loops to be ridden depends on the size of the arena and the stage of training or horse and rider.\nThe simplest loop is a single 5m (16ft) one on the long side.  After the first corner of a long side the horse should be \nstraightened for a moment and then guided into the arena in a shallow loop.  At the E or B markers the horse will be at a \ndistance of 5m (16ft) away from the track.  The rider then rides an equally shallow turn back to the track, reaching it at \nthe marker before the second corner of the long side.'' metadata={''source'': ''basicexercises.pdf'', ''page'': 1}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.316613,
3,"page_content=''135\nWhen riding a double loop each loop will be only 2.50m (8ft) deep.\nSerpentines\nWhen riding serpentines the rider turns at the marker after riding through the first corner of a long side.  He spaces out \nthe required number of loops (usually three or five) at equal distances over the whole arena, and ends at the changing \nmarker before the second corner of the long side.  The loops are counted from centre line to centre line.  The first and last \nloops are then only half-loops, but count as full ones.  Riding a serpentine as in international competitions – i.e. start-\ning and ending at the centre of the short side – should be avoided.  This is because in training horses it is very useful to \nbe able to use the first and last corner of a long side to prepare the horse for the bending that is necessary when riding a \nserpentine.\nTo ride a serpentine correctly the weight aids are most important for turning the horse.  On entering each new loop the \nhorse has to be both flexed and bent in the new direction by shortening the new inside rein and changing weight and leg \naids.  When riding in canter with a simple change of leg, the new canter should be asked for when entering each new \nloop.\nThe constant changing of flexion and bend in a serpentine is very beneficial for both horse and rider.\nTurns at a Halt\nTurns at a halt can be executed either around the forehand or around the haunches.\nWhen riding a turn around the forehand the pivoting point should be close to and at the side of the inside forefoot.  When \nriding a turn around the haunches the pivot point should be at the side of the inside hind foot.\nTurn around the Forehand\nThe turn around the forehand is a suppling exercise and teaches horse and rider the effects of the one-sided aides (side-\nways driving aids).\nFirst of all, the horse – being on the bit – is flexed slightly away from the direction of the turn.  The rein, which has now \nbecome the inside rein, is shortened accordingly.  The rider’s weight is transferred to the inside seat bone.\nThe inside leg should be applied a little behind the girth, pushing the horse’s quarters step by step around the forehand \nuntil the turn is completed.  The horse’s inside hind leg crosses in front of his outside one.  The rider’s outside leg, giving \nsupport behind the girth, meets the quarters distinctly, after every step, creating a little pause.  This prevents the quarters \nfrom turning too fast.\nDuring and after the turn around the forehand, the rider’s legs and seat keep the horse on the bit and prevent him from step-\nping backwards.  If the horse should step forwards, he most likely would fall out on to the outside shoulder.  This should be \ncounteracted by the outside rein.  If the horse steps backwards during the exercise it is considered to be a lesser fault.\nIn an indoor school the turn around the forehand cannot be executed on the track (as there would be no room for the \nhorse’s head and neck in the turn).  The turn should be executed on the inner track.  The inner track is an imaginary track \nabout 0.80m (3ft) inside the ordinary track.\nTurns Around the Haunches\nThe turn around the haunches creates collection.  First of all, the horse – on the bit – should be flexed well in the direc-\ntion of the turn, then the inside rein should guide him into the turn.  The rider’s weight should be increasingly transferred \nto the inside seat bone.  The outside should be brought a little forward.  The inside leg should act close to the girth, driv-\ning the horse forward.  This leg and the supporting outside leg activate the horse’s hind legs to step rhythmically forward \nand closer to his centre of gravity.  Both the rider’s legs inhibit the horse from stepping backwards; the outside support-\ning leg prevents the outside hind foot from deviating sideways.'' metadata={''source'': ''basicexercises.pdf'', ''page'': 2}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.353088,
4,"page_content=''136\nThe outside rein should control the amount of flexion, but must yield enough so that the horse can move uninterrupted in \nthe direction of the turn.\nIn this movement it is essential for the hind legs to maintain an even and regular 4-beat rhythm.\nIt is a minor fault if the horse steps a little forward.  For a novice rider it is even advisable to start the turn by asking the \nhorse to take one or two small steps forward, and only then to begin the turn around the haunches.\nSince the pivoting point of this movement is at the side of the inside hind leg, the horse, in executing the turn, leaves the \ntrack and ends the movement his own width away from the track.  Therefore he has to be guided forward/sideways back \non to the track while completing the last step of the turn.  In this way it is possible to finish the movement correctly, with \nthe horse standing squarely on the track, after the turn around the haunches.\nMain rider faults in the turn around the haunches are:\n•	 Too much outside leg.\n•	 Wrong displacement of the weight (on to the outside seat bone).\n•	 Collapsing the inside hip.\n•	 Too much rein action.\nThese faults usually happen together and cause the horse to step backwards and flex incorrectly, against the direction of \nthe turn.\nTurns at a Pace\nThe turn around the haunches, executed at any pace, is called a HALF-PIROUETTE.\nAt elementary level a pirouette is performed at a walk or collected trot.  (When performed at a collected trot the actual \nturn is also executed at walk.)  The horse may not come to a halt before or after the turn.  The aides are the same as in the \nturn around the haunches.\nThe half-pirouette has the advantage that the horse is already moving forward.  It is easier, therefore, to prevent the horse \nfrom standing on the inside hind leg or even stepping backwards during the turn.\nLeg-yielding\nLeg-yielding is the most basic of all lateral movements.  It is a suppling exercise, making the horse loose and uncon-\nstrained and teaching him to obey the sideways driving aids.  It is an excellent means of teaching the novice rider to \ncoordinate his aids.\nWhen leg-yielding, the horse is straight from head to tail, with a slight flexion away from the direction in which he is \nmoving.  He moves forward/sideways on two tracks.  The inside legs pass and cross in front of the outside legs.\nSince the horse is flexed towards the sideways driving leg, this side is called his ‘inside’, even if it is facing the outside of \nthe arena.\nLeg-yielding can be performed at a walk or – for a short distance – at a trot, on the long sides of the school, on the diago-\nnal, and on the circle.\nWhen leg-yielding along the long side of the school, the novice rider or horse should start by yielding from the leg facing \nthe wall.  When facing the wall at an angle it is easier for horse and rider to get the effect of the sideways driving aids.\nLater on it will be found more beneficial to leg-yield from the inside leg along the wall, with the horse facing the inside \nof the school.\nWhen leg-yielding along the edge of the school the horse should be at a maximum angle of 45˚ to the wall.'' metadata={''source'': ''basicexercises.pdf'', ''page'': 3}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.387479,
5,"page_content=''137\nThe Aids\nThe rider should sit more on the inside seat bone, with his inside leg close behind the girth, pushing the quarters side-\nways.  This leg aid should be applied at the moment when the inside hind leg is lifted off the ground to start a forward/\nsideways step.  If necessary the aid is repeated with every step or stride.  The forehand is guided along its track by the \noutside rein.  By supporting action of the outside leg the rider counteracts any rushing away from the inside leg, and with \nthe supporting outside rein he eliminates any falling out on to the outside shoulder.\nWhen planning to leg-yield along the wall of the school, with the horse’s head towards the wall, the rider should start the \nmove in the first corner of the long side, the rider should apply a half halt.  The fact that the horse is slightly facing the \nwall will help the half halt to have effect (which is another essential reason why this kind of leg yielding should be taught \nfirst to novice riders and/or horses).  The horse should then be straightened and flexed towards the wall.  From this posi-\ntion the rider should start the leg-yield.\nTo finish the leg-yield the horse should be flexed the other way and the forehand should be guided in a shallow turn to \nalign with the hind quarters.  The rider should then proceed straight ahead, and only at this point should he return to the \ntrack.\nWhen leg-yielding along the wall from the leg which is facing the inside of the school, the rider should lead the forehand \na step into the school as though he wanted to change the rein on the diagonal.  The quarters should stay on the track.  The \nrider should then apply a half-halt and start leg-yielding.  To end the leg-yielding he should bring the forehand back to \nthe track in line with the quarters.\nLine-to-Line Leg-Yielding\nTo test and improve the horse’s obedience to the forward/sideways driving leg aid and the guiding outside rein, leg yield-\ning from line to line is a good exercise.\nIn Germany this exercise is carried out from the long side, about 5m (16ft) inwards and then back to the track.\nIt should be ridden in walk or working trot.  The horse moves on two tracks, which are one step apart, with a slight flex-\nion away from the direction of movement nearly parallel to the long side of the arena.  The forehand should be slightly in \nadvance of the quarters.\nAfter passing the first corner of a long side the rider should straighten the horse for a moment.  At the marker, he should \nflex the horse away from the direction of movement.  Then he moves the horse with the – now – inside leg forward/\nsideways into the arena.  The outside leg together with the weight aids keep the horse going well forward and prevent the \nquarters from preceding the forehand.\nThe leg-yielding on the first diagonal into the arena is finished when the horse’s head is nearly in line with the middle of \nthe long side.  He is by the about 5m (16ft) away from the wall.  Here the horse is ridden straight ahead for one horse’s \nlength.  The flexion should then be changed to the opposite side and the rider’s leg should yield the horse back towards \nthe track, which he should meet at the marker before the corner of the long side.'' metadata={''source'': ''basicexercises.pdf'', ''page'': 4}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.430231,

In lateral movements, the horse moves with the forehand and the quarters on two different tracks.\n“The fore and hind legs no longer move on one track but on more than one track forward and sideways.  The hind legs \ncross closely in front of each other.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 138]\nPurpose\n“to improve the obedience of the horse to the cooperative aids of the rider;•	\nto supple all parts of the horse thereby increasing the freedom of his shoulders and the suppleness of his quarters as •	\nwell as the elasticity of the bond connecting the mouth, the poll, the neck, the back and the haunches;\nto improve the cadence and bring the balance and pace into harmony;•	\nto develop and increase the engagement of the quarters and thereby also the collection.”  [•	 USEF Rule Book DR111]\nQualities Desired\n“At the lateral movements the pace should remain free and regular, maintained by a constant impulsion, yet it must be \nsupple, cadenced and balanced.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]\nAids\n“At all lateral movements, the side to which the horse should be bent is the inside.  The opposite side is the outside.”  \n[USEF Rule Book DR111]\n“The rider must be very careful to sit exactly behind the horse’s neck, his shoulders parallel to those of the horse, his hips \nparallel to the hips of the horse.  Only then is it possible to move with the horse, not restrict his movement or bring him \nout of balance.  In lateral work the rider loads the inside seat bone a little more.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 138]\nSource: Riding Logic\nHorse \nis in a \nstraight \nline.\nFlexed to \nthe left.\nBent to the \nleft.\nGiving way to \nthe leg to the \nleft.

Renvers \nto the left.\nCommon Mistakes\n“The impulsion is often lost because of the rider’s preoccupation in bending the horse and pushing him sideways.”  \n[USEF Rule Book DR111]\n“Many riders collapse the inside hip which then actually loads the outside seat bone thus making it easy for the horse to \nlose his Takt (rhythm).”  [The Dressage Horse, pp 138-139]\nTraining Advice\nLateral movements should only be practiced for a relatively short time, now and then interrupted by some energetic \nmovement straight forward, in order to maintain, increase, or restore the impulsion.\n“Should one practice lateral work without having attained a certain degree of collection, there is a danger of throwing the \nhorse onto the shoulder, and the purity of the paces [gaits] will be lost.  The riding of lateral work is based on the ability \nof the horse to have his inside hind leg carry more weight during circle and volte work.  In preparation, ride in walk first, \nso they trust the aids.  It is easier for the horse to learn to move their hind legs forward and sideways.”  [The Dressage \nHorse, p 138]\nAs all flexion at the poll and [bending] the neck have a repercussion on the whole spine, “the bend or flexion must never \nbe exaggerated so that it impairs the balance and fluency of the movement concerned.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]  This \napplies especially to the half-pass where the bend should be less evident than in the shoulder-in, travers and renvers.\nTurn on the Forehand\nDefinition\nThe turn on the forehand is a movement in which the horse’s hindquarters turn around the forelegs which march in place.  \nThe horse is bent in the opposite direction of movement and is therefore stepping away from the rider’s inside leg.  The \nmovement can be ridden as either a 180 or 360 degree turn.\nGymnastic Purpose\n“The half turn on the forehand is an exercise aimed at developing looseness (Losgelassenheit) and also serves to teach \nthe horse to respond to the sideways-pushing aids.  Since the exercise is performed slowly, and can be taken a step at a \ntime, it is a good opportunity for the novice rider to learn and practice each aid and learn to coordinate the aids.”  [Prin-\nciples of Riding, p 107]'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 1}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.796266,
8,"page_content=''61\n“The purpose of the turn is to supple the horse and to teach him obedience to the aids.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, p 69]\n“As a preparation for true dressage, the turn on the forehand has limited value, since a greater proportion of weight has to \nbe on the forehand, whereas the first aim of dressage training is to get the hindquarters to support the greater proportion \nof the total mass.  Nevertheless, the turn on the forehand is a necessary lesson at the beginning of training as it is an easy \nway of acquainting the horse with the predominant effect of the rider’s inside leg.”  [Dressage, A Guidebook for the Road \nto Success, p 47]\nQualities Desired\nThe qualities desired in the turn on the forehand are that the horse steps willingly away from the rider’s leg with regular, \neven steps, without stepping backwards or barging through the bridle.\nAids\n“The half-turn on the forehand is performed as follows:\nThe horse is halted (or walking); so as to avoid making the horse step back or raise its head, when riding in an en-•	\nclosed area, the turn on the forehand should be performed on the inside track, and not up against a wall.\nThe horse is flexed to the side of the sideways-pushing leg.•	\nThe inside-hind foot steps in front of and across the outside hind foot.•	\nAt the end of the exercise, i.e. when the horse has turned through 180 degrees, it is positioned straight again in the •	\nhalt at this point it will be back on the outside track.\nThe following aids are used for the turn on the forehand:\nIn order to obtain the flexion, the rider transfers more of his weight onto the inside seat bone and shortens the new •	\ninside rein.\nThe outside ‘guarding’ rein prevents excessive bend in the head and neck.•	\nWith his inside leg drawn back slightly, the rider pushes the hindquarters, step by step, forwards and sideways •	\naround the forehand; he uses his leg in time with the horse’s movement.\nThe outside ‘guarding’ leg prevents the horse from stepping too far sideways and prevents the movement from •	\nbecoming hurried.\nAt the end of the movement the horse is halted again.”  [•	 Principles of Riding, p 107-108]\n“After the halt, bend him slightly by closing your inside fist until you see the arch above the eye.  [Remember to lengthen \nthe outside rein.]  Put more weight on your inside seat bone.  Squeeze with your inside leg behind the girth and move \nhim, step by step.  If he wants to go backward, urge him forward with both legs.  If he wants to go forward, tighten your \nreins.  Your outside leg on the girth controls the speed (he must move step by step without rushing) and moves the out-\nside fore foot forward.  If he swings the haunches too fast use your outside leg behind the girth.  The outside rein controls \nthe bend.  When you have completed the turn, straighten him and walk on.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, p 72]\nTraining Advice\n“Throughout the turn, the rider must use his legs and weight to keep the horse ‘in front of the leg.’  This is the only way \nto ensure that the horse will remain on the bit and will not escape forwards or step back.”  [Principles of Riding, p 108]\nIf the horse has a strong tendency to be ‘behind the leg,’ it may be helpful to perform the turn on the forehand from the \nwalk.\n“It is often helpful to use the whip behind your inside leg.  The aim, however, is to make the horse obedient to a slight \nsqueeze – a whisper.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, p 72]\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most serious mistake made in the turn on the forehand is to allow the horse to step backwards.  Another common \nmistake is overbending the horse, which allows the horse to fall out the outside shoulder and prevents the proper crossing \nof the hind legs.  This can turn into a “turn around the middle,” which has little loosening effect on the horse.'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 2}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.827566,

The inside legs pass and cross in front of the out-\nside legs.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]  In the leg-yield, the horse is moving sideways and forward on two tracks, away \nfrom the rider’s inside leg.  The leg-yield is performed in the walk and trot.\nGymnastic Purpose\n“Leg-yielding is an exercise aimed at developing looseness (Losgelässenheit) and in particular, making the horse more \nresponsive to the sideways-pushing aids.  It is an excellent exercise for teaching the rider to coordinate the aids.”  [Prin-\nciples of Riding, p 108]\n“It makes the horse obedient to the unilateral aids (legs and hands on the same side) thus suppling him and preparing him \nfor the shoulder-in, the half-pass, travers and renvers.  Leg-yielding is a means to make the horse obedient, not an end in \nitself.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, p 61]\n“Leg-yielding must improve submission to the inside leg and hand and put the horse increasingly on the outside aids.  \nIt is a loosening exercise.  The horse cannot stiffen his inside hind when it is made to cross in front of the outside one \nand engage under the body mass.  As a result, leg-yielding promotes the flexibility and elasticity of the hindquarters.”  \n[Dressage, A Guidebook for the Road to Success, p 45]\nQualities Desired\nThe horse should go both forward and sideways with even, rhythmical \nand fluid steps with a marked loosening of the hindquarters.  When ex-\necuted properly, the leg-yield enhances the connection between the rider’s \ninside leg and outside rein.  Maintaining a steady rhythm is important.\nAids\n“The aids for leg-yielding are as follows:\nThe rider places more weight on the inside seat bone.•	\nThe rider’s inside leg is positioned behind the girth and pushes •	\nforwards and sideways, keeping as far as possible in time with the \nmovement.\nThe rider’s outside leg is placed in a ‘guarding’ position behind the •	\ngirth, preventing the horse from moving its hindquarters too far side-\nways.  It is also responsible for maintaining the forward movement.\nThe rider ‘feels’ the inside rein in order to obtain the flexion.•	\nThe rider ‘gives’ sufficiently with the outside rein to allow the flex-•	\nion while still maintaining a steady contact with the horse’s mouth.  \nHe also uses the outside rein to prevent the horse bending its head \nand neck excessively and falling out onto the outside shoulder.”  \n[Principles of Riding, p 95]\nTraining Advice\n“Leg-yielding can be performed on the diagonal, in which case the horse \nshould be as close as possible parallel to the long sides of the arena, al-\nthough the forehand should be slightly in advance of the quarters.  It can \nalso be performed along the wall, which case the horse should be at an \nangle of about 35 degrees to the direction in which he is moving.”  [USEF \nRule Book DR111]\nSource: Practical Dressage Manual\nLeg yielding across half a diagonal and \nstraight forward on center line.'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 3}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.860322,

When this happens, the horse \ndoes not properly cross the inside legs over the outside legs, thus losing the \nloosening effect of the exercise.

The horse is ridden with a slight \nbut uniform bend around the inside leg of the rider maintaining cadence at a \nconstant angle of approximately 30 degrees.  The horse’s inside foreleg passes \nand crosses in front of the outside foreleg; the inside hind leg steps forward \nunder the horse’s body weight following the same track of the outside foreleg, \nwith the lowering of the inside hip.  The horse is bent away from the direction \nin which it is moving.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]\n“The inside hind leg is brought well forward in the direction of the outside \nforeleg.  The inside hock is engaged more and carries most of the weight because of the diagonal position of the horse, \nthe lateral bend, and the increased collection.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 39]\n“Standing in front of the horse, one should see only three legs.  The inside foreleg, the outside foreleg which hides the \ninside hind, and the outside hind.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 140]\n“Shoulder-in is a lateral movement in which a horse is on three tracks:\ntrack 1 = outside hind,\ntrack 2 = inside hind and outside fore,\ntrack 3 = inside fore.  The rider slightly displaces the forehand to the inside of the track.  The horse is bent away from \nthe direction in which it is moving.  The bend through the body is created by the horse slightly lowering its inside hip \nand bringing its inside hind more under its body and into the track of the outside foreleg, allowing it to go on three \ntracks.”  [Canadian Equestrian Federation Coaching Manual Level III, p 23]\nGymnastic Purpose\nThe objective of the shoulder-in is to achieve a higher degree of collection as well as ‘Durchlässigkeit’ (throughness), \nlightness, and better balance.  This, in turn, improves the horse’s straightness.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 39]\n“Because of the positioning of the horse to the inside, the carrying ability of the quarters is asked more [challenged], \nloaded more and flexed more – thus the horse gains in collection.  Because of the positioning of the horse to the inside, \nthe pushing aids can be increased without fear of not being able to hold it through [losing the bend] – this allows an \nimprovement in Schwung.\nThe ability of the horse to bend through his length is advanced, improving the straightening ability of the horse.

The forward-sideways movement refines \nthe horse’s obedience to the leg and with it the entire ‘throughness’ of the \nhorse.  Finally, the shoulder-in is a marvelous method to make the horse \nsofter and more supple in the jowl.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 140]\n“Shoulder-in is used to supple and engage a horse and make him obedi-\nent to the aids.  It is not only a suppling movement but also a collecting \nmovement, because every step the horse must move his inside hind leg \nunderneath his body and place it in front of the outside hind leg, which \nhe is unable to do without lowering his inside hip.”  [Practical Dressage \nManual, p 97]\nQualities Desired\nThe qualities desired are correct bend, better collection and engagement \nof the inside hind leg, maintenance of the rhythm, regularity and balance \nas well as lightness, suppleness and ease of movement.\nAids\n“The horse is led into the shoulder-in with a half-halt.  The inside rein \n‘guides’ the forehand to the inside.  The outside hand allows the shoulder \nto move forward and limits the bend passively.  As in turning, the inside \nrein shows the way, the outside rein gives support, thus maintaining bal-\nance.  The rider slightly weights the inside seat bone and checks that the \nshoulder does not come behind the movement.  The inside lower leg lies closely to the girth to maintain the bend in the \nribs, causing the inside hind leg to step forward, and maintain the sideways movement.\nThe outside lower leg is passive unless required when the outside hind leg falls out.  To finish the shoulder-in, the outside \nrein and inside lower leg guide the forehand back to the track.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 140]\nTraining Advice\n“In practice, the shoulder-in is continued coming out of the first corner of the long side, as the horse is already bending \nand it is easier to draw the inside hind leg underneath.  One rides out of the corner as if one wishes to carry on with the \nturn leading with the inside rein and lower leg into the sidewards movement.  In the beginning, one uses less flexion and \nangle, that is to say, one rides shoulder-fore and then by increasing the flexion, leads into a few steps of shoulder-in. \nShould the Takt (rhythm) and/or Schwung (swing/impulsion) be lost, or should the required bend be lost, one leads the \nhorse back to the track, flexes him equally on both reins and rides him forward before beginning again with the shoulder-\nin.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 141]\n“If one feels that the bend is insufficient at the beginning of the shoulder-in, a correct course is to execute one or more \nvoltes.  Whenever one feels that the hind limbs are starting to disengage and to slacken, the best procedure is to ride for-\nwards energetically toward the center of the arena until impulsion is restored and only then resume the lateral movement \non the new track.”  [Dressage, A Guidebook for the Road to Success, p 73]\nCommon Mistakes\n“The horse’s neck is bent too much, often seen when the angle of the movement is too narrow.”  [•	 Practical Dressage \nManual, p 105]  “This is mostly the result of too strong an inside rein action, causing too much bend in the neck.  \nThe fault is corrected by using less inside rein and stronger controlling influence of the outside rein (outside half-\nhalt) with the hand carried lower and close to the withers.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 40]\n“The angle is too wide, which impairs the freedom, regularity and harmony of the pace, and restricts the impulsion.”  •	\n[Practical Dressage Manual, p 105]  “This is usually caused by using the inside leg too strongly and too far back.  \nThe rider must also be careful that the horse does not tilt its head.

On the right rein especially, one can see that •	\nthe right ear is lower.  This can be because the rider hangs onto the outside rein, working with too strong an outside \nhand, or that the horse does not step evenly into both reins.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, p 105]\nTravers and Renvers\nDefinition\n“Travers.  This exercise can be performed in collected trot or collected canter.  The horse is slightly bent round the inside \nleg of the rider but with a greater degree of bend than in shoulder-in.  A constant angle of approximately 35 degrees \nshould be shown, from the front and from behind one sees four tracks.  The forehand remains on the track and the \nquarters are moved inwards.  The horse’s outside legs pass and cross in front of the inside legs.  The horse is bent in the \ndirection in which it is moving.  To start the travers, the quarters must leave the track or, after a corner or circle, are not \nbrought back onto the track.  At the end of the travers, the quarters are brought back on the track without any counter-\nflexion of the poll/neck as one would finish a circle.\nRenvers.  This is the inverse movement in relation to travers, with the tail instead of the head to the wall.  Otherwise the \nsame principles and conditions are applicable as at the travers.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]\n“In travers and renvers the horse is bent and flexed in the direction of his movement.  In travers, the quarters are to the \ninside of the arena.  In renvers, it is the forehand that is to the inside.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 146]\nGymnastic Purpose\n“Travers and renvers complete the gymnasticising started with the shoulder-in.  They have the same gymnastic aims, but \nthe flexion and the bend must be greater than that of the shoulder-in.  Through the flexion and bend in the direction of \nmovement, the outside hind leg is drawn under the center of gravity of the horse and rider.  The inside hind leg is more \nloaded as the weight of the horse is now shifted over the inside hind leg.  For the horse, travers and renvers – in compari-\nson to shoulder-in, are the most strenuous lessons.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 146]\nThe benefit of working in travers is not the crossing over the outside hind leg, but the increased engagement of the inside \nhind leg, which has to bend more and carry more weight.  In addition, it encourages a better overall obedience to leg and \nrein aids.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 42]\nThe renvers “is an excellent means of establishing the horse’s lateral bend, as the quarters are supported by the wall of the \nschool and the rider has a good chance to control the horse’s outside shoulder.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 48]\nQualities Desired\nThe qualities desired are the same as for shoulder-in, except that there is a greater degree of collection in travers and \nrenvers with more engagement and bending of the three joints of the inside hind leg.\nAids\nAids described below are for travers.  Renvers, requires an opposite movement.  To develop the travers, the rider gives \nthe horse more flexion in the beginning and starts the movement with a half-halt.  The outside lower leg lies behind the \ngirth, pushing the quarters of the horse to the inside of the arena, and also bending the horse around the inside lower leg \nwhile controlling the forward/sideways movement.\n“The rider’s head and neck are turned in the direction of the track, his chest and shoulders must be turned somewhat \ninward, parallel to the horse’s shoulders, and his outside hip must be held back to correspond with the position of his \noutside leg.  The rider must sit to the inside.”  [Dressage, A Guidebook to the Road to Success, p 70]'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 6}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.97325,
13,"page_content=''66\nTraining Advice\n“Travers is best developed out of the first corner of a long side, as the \nhorse is already bent around the inside leg in the corner and the rider \nnow needs only to guide the quarters to the inside of the track with the \noutside lower leg.  As in the beginning the flexion and bend in the direc-\ntion of movement is very difficult for the horse, one must only gradually \nincrease the bend around the inside leg.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 147]\n“To finish the travers correctly and to return to riding on one track, the \nhorse’s forehand is brought into the school and aligned with the quar-\nters.  Then, maintaining the flexion in the poll, the otherwise straight-\nened horse is brought with the inside leg aids sideways back to the track \non the long side.  This should be done in good time, so that when reach-\ning the corner marker the horse is back on the track and totally straight.”  \n[Advanced Techniques of Riding, pp 45-46]\n“Should the horse show irregular paces or faulty carriage the rider must \nabandon the travers and energetically ride straight ahead, re-establishing \nthe horse’s basic obedience.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 44]\n“For renvers, one again begins out of the first corner of a long side lead-\ning a horse initially into shoulder-in, and then carefully changing the flexion and bend into the direction of movement, \nwithout losing the Takt and Schwung.  As renvers is more difficult than travers, it is for this reason that one first of all \nguides the forehand to the inside of the track, and then gives the bend and flexion into the direction of movement.”  [The \nDressage Horse, p 147]\nCommon Mistakes\n“The main mistake in travers and renvers is too strong a flexion of the horse in the neck, without the relative bend in the \nribs. \nThe horse may also be at too steep an angle to the track.\nHe may move more sideways than forward/sideways, holding himself back and, therefore, not correctly moving forward \nfrom the spot.  In this case the inside lower leg must work harder, with the outside rein holding a little more firmly, thus \nlimiting the bend of the horse to a greater extent.\nMistakes such as tilting the head, coming behind the bit, or errors in Takt can also occur as in shoulder-in and should be \ncorrected in the same way as described for shoulder-in.\nIt can also occur, that while performing travers and renvers, the horse may canter on.  This is a mistake that is best not \ncorrected on a straight line.  The rider should proceed in the movement, that is, proceed in travers and renvers further, \nuntil the horse comes back into the trot.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 147]\nHalf-Pass\nDefinition\n“Half-pass.  This movement is a variation of travers, executed on the diagonal instead of along the wall.  The horse \nshould be slightly bent round the inside leg of the rider in order to give more freedom and mobility to the shoulders, thus \nadding ease and grace to the movement although the forehand should be slightly in advance of the quarters.  The outside \nlegs pass and cross in front of the inside legs.  The horse is looking in the direction in which he is moving.  He should \nmaintain the same cadence and balance throughout the whole movement.  In order to give more freedom and mobility to \nthe shoulders, which adds to the ease and grace of the movement, it is of great importance, not only that the horse is cor-\nrectly bent and thereby prevented from protruding his inside shoulder,  but also to maintain the impulsion, especially the \nengagement of the inside hind leg.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]\nSource: USEF Rule Book\nTravers                             Renvers'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 7}",2024-12-30 01:04:14.997478,
14,"page_content=''67\n“In half-pass the horse moves forwards and sideways along imaginary tracks.  As in travers, the horse is bent around the \nrider’s inside leg and is flexed into the direction in which he is going.  The half-pass is ridden almost parallel to the track, \nthe shoulders always a little in advance of the quarters.  This is especially important since the shoulders are slightly nar-\nrower than the quarters and therefore the inside shoulder has to be brought that little fraction more into the direction of \nthe movement.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 48]  Half-pass can be performed at collected trot, collected canter, or \npassage.\nGymnastic Purpose\n“The purpose of the half-pass is the same of the travers:  suppling the horse evenly on both sides and improving the col-\nlection by increased engagement of the inside hind leg.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 48]\nQualities Desired\nThe horse “should maintain the same cadence and balance throughout the whole movement.  In order to give more \nfreedom and mobility to the shoulders, which adds to the ease and grace of the movement, it is of great importance, not \nonly that the horse is correctly bent and thereby prevented from protruding his inside shoulder, but also to maintain the \nimpulsion, especially the engagement of the inside hind leg.”  [USEF Rule Book DR111]\nAids for Half-Pass\nThe aids for the half-pass are the same as for travers along the wall.  Before starting the half-pass, it is advisable to ride \nthe first few strides in shoulder-fore position to make sure that the horse’s inside shoulder is leading.  The transition into \nhalf-pass will be especially fluent if the rider takes care that the horse makes the first step sideways with his inside fore-\nleg.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, 1991, p 49]\nTraining Advice\nThe half-pass can be ridden across the full school or half the school, either from the track toward the centerline, or vice \nversa.  It can also be ridden as a counter change of hand or zig-zag.\n“On leaving the track out of the corner onto the long side, use the flexion and bend that the horse had in the corner, and \nthen lead the quarters into the school with the outside lower leg.  In the half-pass, the forehand should lead the quarters, \nthe opposite of travers.  Many riders make the same mistake at the start of the half-pass of using the outside leg too much \n            Source: Practical Dressage Manual\nShoulder-in and Half-pass\n             Source: Practical Dressage Manual\nHalf-circle and Half-pass'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 8}",2024-12-30 01:04:15.03865,

When for \ninstance in counter-change of hand at half-pass to either side of the center line the number of meters or strides to either \nside is prescribed in the  test, it must be strictly observed and the movement be executed symmetrically.”  [USEF Rule \nBook DR111]\n“In the beginning, one should not ride the canter half-pass too steeply, but possibly come out of the first corner of the \nlong side and aim for the end of the center line.  The horse can gain confidence in where to put his legs and trust in the \nsideways movement.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 173]\nCommon Mistakes\n“With half-pass, the same problems can arise as in travers and renvers.  If this is not the fault of the rider and cannot \nquickly be corrected, it is of greater use to move back into travers or shoulder-in, or maybe even circles, rather than con-\ntinue in half-pass.  That is to say, one should move back a step in the training of the horse and correct the problem there.\nShould the quarters lead in the half-pass, the horse loses Schwung, as the hind legs are no longer stepping in the direction \nof movement, but sideways away from that direction.  The rider then has great difficulty in achieving the desired point \nin the arena that he is aiming for.  As a correction, the inside lower leg must be applied more to hold the quarters.  Then \nthrough increased activity of the lower back, lighter inside hand and pushing with the outside leg, the horse should be \nbrought again to fluent over-stepping the half-pass.\nShould the horse be too bent and flexed in his head and neck but not bent enough in his ribs, thus causing the quarters to \ntrail, the rider must use more and more outside leg to bend the horse round the inside lower leg.  The outside rein must \nlimit the bend of the horse firmly.  The rider will find that it is best to improve the bend in the ribs by returning to circles \nand shoulder-in.\nIt is very common, especially in half-pass left, that the horse can twist his neck and tilt his head.  As a correction for this, \none must be very accurate in riding the correct flexion of the half-pass, and lift the right hand a little higher.”  [The Dres-\nsage Horse, p 155]\n“If during training, the rider detects signs of any of these faults, he must stop the half-pass immediately and ride energeti-\ncally forward, regardless of whether he has finished the movement or not.  To correct any of these faults, we advise riding \non voltes, riding a figure eight, decreasing and enlarging a circle, shoulder-in, renvers and travers, as well as transitions to \nmedium and extended trot and canter.\nThe most common rider errors in the half-pass are incorrect weight distribution, collapsing the inside hip, which usually \ninvolves the inside hand crossing the withers to the outside.  In counter-change of hand during half-pass, riders are often \ntoo eager to get into the new direction, do not sit quietly enough (especially when flying changes are involved) and cause \nthe horse to throw himself into the new direction with the quarters leading.”  [Advanced Techniques of Riding, p 50]\nTurn on the Haunches\nDefinition\n“This movement is a schooling exercise which can be executed from a halt or walk, and is preparatory for the pirouette \nwhich is executed out of a collected gait.  The horse’s forehand moves in even, quiet and regular steps around the horse’s \ninner hind leg while maintaining the rhythm of the walk.  In the half turn on the haunches the horse is not required to step \nwith its inside hind leg in the same spot each time it leaves the ground but may move slightly forward.  This movement \nmay be executed through 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 360 degrees.”  [USEF Rule Book DR112]\nGymnastic Purpose\n“It is used to simulate the activity of the hind limbs when they carry the greater proportion of the combined weight \nof horse and rider.  It is a movement designed to improve collection and flexion of the haunches.  It is also meant to \nheighten the sensitivity of the horse to the forward and lateral driving actions of the legs, and to the restraining actions of \nthe hands, and as such, is an important lesson in submission.”  [Dressage, A Guidebook for the Road to Success, p 53]'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 9}",2024-12-30 01:04:15.100394,

Sit \ninward.  The inside rein bends the horse \nslightly and leads the horse, step by step, \naround the inside hind leg.  Your inside \nleg on the girth maintains the bend and \nprevents the inside hind leg from falling \nin.  The outside leg moves the horse and \nprevents the quarters from falling out.  The \noutside rein defines the degree of the bend \nand, if necessary, supports the outside \nleg.  Look in the direction you will move \nand feel that you are turning yourself and \ntaking your horse with you.  You should \nlead with the inside rein, rather than pull.”  \n[Practical Dressage Manual, p 95]\n“The inside rein, which can exert a slight-\nly sideways action, leads the horse into the \nturn.

A much worse mistake is a backward step, usually caused \nwhen the horse is not working through its back, or when the rider’s hands are riding backward and not allowing move-\nment to come through.  One often sees horses that are thrown around instead of moving step by step.  The horse loses his \n‘Takt’ and pivots on the hind leg.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 134]\nTraining Advice\n“The activity of the hindquarters can be maintained only by agility in the use of the rider’s legs, supported, if necessary be \nenlivening touches in rapid succession with the spurs.

It is usually carried out at a collected walk or canter but can also be exe-\ncuted at piaffe.  The forefeet and the outside hind foot move round the inside hind foot which forms the pivot and should \nreturn to the same spot, or slightly in front of it, each time it leaves the ground.”  [USEF Rule Book DR112]\nGymnastic Purpose\n“The canter-pirouette has its origin in those far gone days when extreme maneuverability of the horse was required for \nman-to-man combat in war.  In a somewhat different form, it remains part of the repertoire of horses used in bull-fighting \nor working with cattle.  It is certainly one of the most difficult movements demanded of a horse.  The canter-pirouette is \na movement that no horse will ever execute spontaneously.  A pirouette in six to eight bounds of canter is the ultimate \ntouchstone of collection, of flexibility of the haunches, of carrying power of the hindquarters, of impulsion and of abso-\nlute submission of the aids.  Because a coefficient of 2 is placed on them in tests, they have as decisive an influence on \nvictory in modern friendly contests in a dressage arena as they once had on the battlefield.”  [Dressage, A Guidebook for \nthe Road to Success, p 115]\n“Only horses that are able to bend the quarters and have sufficient strength to raise the quarters again are in the position \nto carry out a correct pirouette.  The actual practice of the pirouette itself leads to a greater gymnasticising of the quar-\nters.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 178]\nQualities Desired\n“At whatever gait the pirouette (half-pirouette) is executed the horse slightly bent in the direction in which he is turning \nshould, remaining on the bit with a light contact, turn smoothly round maintaining the exact cadence and sequence of \nfootfalls of that pace.  The poll stays the highest point during the entire movement.\nDuring the pirouettes (half-pirouettes) the horse should maintain his impulsion and never in the slightest way move \nbackwards or deviate sideways.  If the inside hind foot is not raised and returned to the ground in the same rhythm as the \noutside hind foot the gait is no longer regular.\nIn executing the pirouette or the half-pirouette in canter, the rider should maintain perfect lightness of the horse while ac-\ncentuating the collection.  The quarters are well-engaged and lowered and show a good flexion of the joints.  An integral \npart of the movement is the canter strides before and after the pirouette.  These should be characterized by an increased \nactivity and collection before the pirouette and, the movement having been completed, by the balance being maintained \nas the horse proceeds.\nThe quality of the pirouettes (half-pirouettes) is judged according to the suppleness, lightness, cadence and regularity \nand to the precision and smoothness of the transitions; pirouettes (half-pirouettes) at canter are judged also according to \nthe balance, the elevation and the number of strides (at pirouettes 6-8, at half-pirouettes 3-4 are desirable).”  [USEF Rule \nBook DR112]\n“In canter pirouette, the quarters should describe the smallest possible circle, but the horse should not lose the clear \nthree-beat of the canter.  The canter stride should be quiet and expressive, with a clear lowering of the quarters.  The \ninside hind leg takes more of the load.  The canter strides in the pirouette should not become quicker or slower than the \nnormal canter strides before or after the pirouette.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 178]\nAids\n“The canter pirouette is best prepared with half-halts so that the turn is more on the spot, and with the correct flexion of \nthe horse into the direction of movement.\nThe rider’s outside lower leg lies behind the girth and holds the sideways movement.\nThe riders’ inside leg prevents the falling out of the horse, which would cause the quarters to lead the shoulder.

Half-halts regulate the rhythm and main-\ntain the quarters on the smallest possible circle.\nThe rider must sit especially well into the direction of the movement with weight on the inside seat bone to make it easier \nfor the horse to step under his body.”  [The Dressage Horse, p 178]\n“Establish a correct rhythm with good engagement so he can ‘sit’ at the pirouette with well bent joints.  He must be sup-\nple.  If he is tense, he will probably whirl around above the bit.  Sit inward.  Look in the direction you turn and take the \nhorse with you.  Both legs behind the girth maintain the canter, keeping the hind legs active.  The inside leg maintains the \nbend in cooperation with the inside rein and prevents the haunches from falling in.  It is a common fault that the inside \nhind foot move inward at the first stride of the pirouette.  The rider’s outside leg moves the horse around and prevents \nthe haunches from falling out.  The inside rein leads the horse into the turn–do not pull him backward.  The outside rein \ncontrols the bend and supports the outside leg.”  [Practical Dressage Manual, pp 129-130]\nTraining Advice\n“To begin the pirouette, the horse should have learned to collect himself well and to canter well.  The horse should also \nbe confident in canter half-passes.\nPractice pirouettes by reducing the size of the circle that the horse is working on.  Ride a little in travers canter.  When \nthe horse manages this well, reduce the size of the circle until the horse is in a pirouette.  If it becomes difficult for the \nhorse to carry himself, or should he lose the three-beat of the canter, increase the size again.\nA problem in the pirouette is when the horse throws himself around.  The horse is unable to hold its balance enough with \nthe inside hind leg.  One should ride the pirouette on a bigger circle.  In addition, the outside rein and inside lower leg \nmust actively prevent the horse from spinning round.\nSome horses actually sit too much on their quarters in the pirouette, bringing the hind legs up to the forelegs and jump \nlike a hare with both hind legs at the same time.  These horses lift themselves too high in front and therefore come above \nthe bit.  As a correction, one should first of all flex the horse deep and ride him through his back again.”  [The Dressage \nHorse, p 182]\n“A useful exercise to prepare green horses for canter pirouettes is to determine if the horse can canter on the spot and \nmaintain the quickness of his hind legs and be able to be pushed forward out of that rather than just escaping.  The horse \nhas to be very pliable forward and back again with the confidence that he can sit there and canter maybe six steps almost \non the spot still thinking in his mind that he’s forward.”  [Dressage Insights: Excerpts from Experts, p 117]\n“I do an exercise on a square, like riding a box, where I go straight maybe five, six or seven strides, and then do a quarter \nturn onto another straight line to keep the horses from anticipating and throwing themselves around.”  [Dressage In-\nsights: Excerpts from Experts, p 118]\nCommon Mistakes\n“The impulsion, cadence and regular sequence of the legs are not maintained; the horse spins around, executing •	\nonly a few strides at a tense and hurried canter.\nThe horse is not bent to the direction in which he is turning.•	\nThe inside hind foot is not raised and returned to the same spot or almost to the same spot, or it moves inward the •	\nfirst stride.\nThe haunches move on a circle which, however is a lesser fault than being stuck to the ground, losing the rhythm of •	\nthe canter.\nThe horse moves backward (a serious fault).•	\nThe canter is sometimes disunited, the horse changing the leg, often only for a fraction of a second and solely with •	\nhis hind legs.'' metadata={''source'': ''movements1.pdf'', ''page'': 12}",2024-12-30 01:04:15.188413,
